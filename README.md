## inspiration
Over the years, I have received thousands of spam calls, and recently I have sound kitboga's youtube and twitch. It has been wonderful to watch someone waste the scammers time as much as they waste ours. For that reason I am going to help work to improve some of the tools that can be used for wasting their time.
